## Hi there 👋

This is a passion project that aims at de-googlify the services I use. This will be a set of self hosted applications
and tools that are supposed to work in a hybrid cloud configuration. I have lots of plans, but not a lot of time, and it's
all a big work in progress. The idea is for it to be all open source, under a cc licence for non commercial use. There are a lot
of services that I am aiming at replacing and it will take a looot of time and resources to do them all, so if the project interests
you and you'd like to get involved let me know! Also if you want to support the project on buymeacoffee/ko-fi please do so too! It'll
keep the motivation coming.
